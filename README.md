# Patent-Analysis
This project was based on the concepts of Text Analytics. The data consisted of details of patents from 13 different countires.
Data was Pre-processed by normalizing, removing stop words and lemmatizing to find the similarity among companies based on their patents(title and abstract.
Identified the similarity in patents by using TF-IDF vectorizer and unsupervised learning models: Multi-Dimensional scaling, Hierarchical clustering, and K-means algorithm.
5 topics were obtained using topic modeling algorithms: NMF, LSA and LDA. All models were compared to assess the similarity between topics.
